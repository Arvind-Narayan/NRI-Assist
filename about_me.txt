After 8 long years of living and building a career in the US, I surprised myself when I realized it was time to move back home. This decision was both the most rewarding and the most challenging one I’ve ever made. Leaving behind the life I had built wasn't easy, and the logistical journey that followed took over 6 months of intense effort and determination.

If you find yourself at a similar crossroads, know that I understand the mix of emotions and concerns you're experiencing. Since my return, many have reached out to me, seeking advice and sharing their own stories of contemplating a move back to India.

I’m here to offer support, share my experiences, and help as many people as possible navigate this life-changing journey. This platform is one way for me to do that.
